"""
Let us build a system that will tell you what to watch next based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies.
1. Read in the movies.txt file. Each separate line is a description of a different movie.
2. Your task is to create a function to return which movies a user would watch next if they have watched Planet Hulk with the description 
"Will he save their world or destroy it? When the Hulk becomes too dangerous for the Earth, 
the Illuminati trick Hulk into a shuttle and launch him into space to a planet where the Hulk can live in peace. Unfortunately, 
Hulk land on the planet Sakaar where he is sold into slavery and trained as a gladiator."
3. The function should take in the description as a parameter and return the title of the most similar movie.

Pre-requisites:
install spacy library
install the english md model (en_core_web_md)

Running the program:
Download the files in the repo on your machine, open the watch_next.py file with your preferred IDE.
